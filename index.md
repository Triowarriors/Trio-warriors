   <b>What is sikshana pedia app</b> ?   
It is a project based learning app where students can complete their education at their own pace. It has the Facility to upload the project which automatically gets synced when connected to the internet. Teachers can provide feedback in the same projects in form of stars.Educational videos can be contextualised. For Eg, If I am studying maths the video automatically uses my name or my classmate’s name in the problem

 <b> Our Inspiration </b> <br>  
 
 During the 1st wave of the pandemic many people got affected. Then when the schools opened many of the kids could even attend school. Then we saw that Agastya foundation and lenovo partnered up to give devices to kids. So , we thought that we could could do something for the community. It was a really good chance to do something nice for the society.
