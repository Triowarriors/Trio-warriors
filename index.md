<b>Welcome to team Trio Warriors's website</b>
We are a team of 3 Ownterns where we are trying to get the used / unused electronic devices to the underprivieged kids. 
We are working this project with <b> RaiseToPi <b> in collaboration with <b> Sikshana Foundation <b> <br>
 Your kindness and cooperation can be the source of education for these underprivileged kids. By donating your used / unused electronic devices you will help 
  these underprivleged kids to continue their education while the schools are still closed.

  <b> Our Inspiration </b> <br>  
 
Based on government, data only 15% of the students which is almost 4.5 lakh students in Karnataka had access to internet . We thought to take up this idea because children in government schools have not been able to attend classes the last year and should not be repeated this year. 
There will be a gap in learning if they discontinue .

   <b>What is sikshana pedia app</b> ?   
It is a project based learning app where students can complete their education at their own pace. It has the Facility to upload the project which automatically gets synced when connected to the internet. Teachers can provide feedback in the same projects in form of stars.Educational videos can be contextualised. For Eg, If I am studying maths the video automatically uses my name or my classmate’s name in the problem.
 
 The app has got the DCERT curiculam for all classes and can be easily accessed with worksheets .
